## Task:
Write an application char-counter that takes a string and returns the number of unique characters in the string.

It is expected that a string with the same character sequence may be passed several times to the method.

Since the counting operation can be time-consuming, the method should cache the results, so that when the method is given a string previously encountered,

it will simply retrieve the stored result. Use collections and maps where appropriate.

E.g.

## Problem:

Main purpose of this task is to get my hands on the Collections Framework. By providing useful data structures and algorithms, it frees you to concentrate on the important parts of your program rather than on the low-level "plumbing", provides high-performance, high-quality implementations of data structures.
Project is written in clean-code style and is fully unit-tested.

## Technologies used:
* Plain Java
* Junit
* Collection Framework

## Design patterns used:
* Decorator pattern
